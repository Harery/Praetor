# PRAETOR

> **P**roduction **R**eadiness, **A**udit, **E**vidence, **T**esting,
> **O**perations, & **R**eview

A single-prompt, multi-agent system that turns any codebase into a complete
readiness package: test cases, runbooks, alert specs, support triage trees,
customer comms, compliance evidence, and a consolidated risk register —
with full file-line traceability.

One prompt run. Six disciplines served (QA, QC, Security, Operations,
Support, Compliance). Zero hand-holding required between teams.

## What Praetor Does

Reads your repository, then dispatches 18 expert agent personas (each
with a 12-20 year persona, defined scope, and unilateral authority in
their domain) to produce:

| Audience | Receives |
|---|---|
| `[ENG]` Engineering & QA | Test cases (unit + integration + security + perf + a11y + chaos), executable scripts (k6, Playwright, fast-check), secret-scan / secret-lint CI stage |
| `[BIZ]` Business | Plain-language verification matrices, UAT scripts |
| `[OPS]` Operations / SRE | 3am-grade runbooks, alert specs in detected monitoring syntax (Datadog/Prometheus/etc.) |
| `[SUP]` Support / CX | Triage decision trees, error translations, customer comm templates |
| `[COMP]` Compliance & Security | Control mappings (SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA/PCI/WCAG), PII flows, audit evidence |
| Cross-cutting | Consolidated risk register with severity, owner, dev-day estimate |

> **How the agents run:** Praetor is a single model adopting many expert
> personas in one context — sequentially simulated, not literally parallel.
> The discipline (scopes, handoffs, dedup, independent QC) is real; the
> concurrency is a structuring device.

Every artifact carries a STATUS tag, an Agent attribution, linked register
IDs, and a file:line citation that is re-derived at emit by a 4-judge
Quality Council (a reviewed draft requiring human spot-check — not external
certification).

## Installation

| Method | Command |
|:---|:---|
| **npm** | `npx praetor-audit-kit` |
| **GitHub Release** | Download [`praetor-prompt-kit-v2.5.zip`](https://github.com/Harery/Praetor/releases/tag/v2.5) |
| **Claude Code** | `claude skill install Skill/praetor.skill` |
| **Direct** | Copy `00-orchestrator/MASTER_PROMPT.md` into your LLM context |

## Quick Start

> **New to Praetor?** Read `GETTING_STARTED.md` for a first-time, step-by-step
> walkthrough written for non-experienced users. The steps below are the short version.

1. Copy the contents of `00-orchestrator/MASTER_PROMPT.md`
2. Paste into your LLM (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, or any long-context model)
3. Append:
   ```
   Source: <github URL | local path | uploaded files>
   ```
4. Send. Phase 0–2 run silently for ~2 minutes.
5. You receive a Discovery Report with a MUST CONFIRM block. Reply per
   the Conditional Continue protocol:
   ```
   continue with:
     Q1 = <answer>
     Q2 = unknown
   override:
     RUN_MODULES = [M_AUTH]
     RUN_PRIORITIES = [P0]
   then continue
   ```
6. Per-module outputs follow. Reply `continue` for the next module, or
   `halt` to stop with a resumable snapshot you can paste back later.
7. Phase 6 wrap-up emits automatically with the executive summary.

## Core Properties

- **Multi-agent orchestration** — 18 specialist personas, sequentially simulated, each with declared persona, authority, and refusal conditions
- **Quality Council review** — 4 judges (Coverage / Correctness / Clarity / Skip-Validity); all *applicable* judges must assent
- **Re-derived citations** — every file:line claim is re-opened at emit; treat as a reviewed draft, spot-check before use as audit evidence
- **Layer-aware deduplication** — Coverage Ledger uses `DUPLICATE_OF` for same-layer matches and `RELATED_TO` for cross-layer scenarios
- **Tooling adaptation** — detects your stack (Datadog/Sentry/Prometheus/etc.) by name/config and emits artifacts in the matching syntax (never reads secret values)
- **Tool-agnostic** — if nothing detected, emits generic format with adoption recommendations
- **Secret hygiene** — runnable secret-scan / secret-lint CI stage from A06
- **Conditional gating** — Phase 3 MUST CONFIRM block; partial answers; structured overrides; resumable `halt`
- **Root cause grouping** — multiple symptom tests share an RC-ID so bug counts don't inflate
- **Regression prevention** — Phase 6 ties every CRITICAL/HIGH fix to a CI gate + alert + runbook
- **Test fixtures included** — every test ships with seed SQL and teardown
- **Self-consistency check** — `tools/check_consistency.sh` keeps the kit's own headline facts aligned across files

## What Praetor Does Not Do

- ❌ Execute the generated tests (you/your CI run them)
- ❌ Deploy fixes
- ❌ Send customer communications
- ❌ File tickets automatically
- ❌ Replace human review
- ❌ Externally certify its citations (it re-derives; you spot-check)

It produces the specifications. Your team executes them.

## Running Modes

| Goal | Override |
|---|---|
| Full run (default) | (no override) |
| Discovery only | `RUN_PHASES = [0,1,2,3]` |
| P0 readiness floor | `RUN_PRIORITIES = [P0]` |
| Under-resourced triage | `RUN_CATEGORIES = [B,C,D]`, `RUN_PRIORITIES = [P0]` |
| Single critical module | `RUN_MODULES = [M_PAYMENTS]` |
| Compliance audit prep | `RUN_CATEGORIES = [E]` |
